# OpenSlab
![Openslab image](https://github.com/Lithopop/OpenSlab/blob/main/Gallery/IMG20250224133220.jpg?raw=true)
flexible and rugged open source low profile leverless controller 

Openslab is an attempt to bridge the gap between the mod-ability of traditional fight sticks and the form factor of PCB based leverless designs.

Print Instructions
-----------
Frame Common Files - Mandatory files regardless of layout or plate materials. There are options for both USB C and B top walls here, and the corners are mirrored, allowing you to swap them around and put a shoulder strap or lanyard on any side, or just print 2 copies of the bottom corners if you don't want the mount points. Also note that there are arrows on the inside of all of the frame wall pieces. these should print facing up, because the top face is slightly thicker  than the bottom (4mm top, 3mm bottom) Also included is a cable cover to tidy up some wiring.


3d print plates common files - this is a collection of print files needed for a fully 3d printed leveless fight stick, that include the center brace (not part of the walls section because it's not used in acrylic builds), the assemblies f to house electronic components (gpio and display), the buttons for the GPIO which will need you to print 4 copies, and the 2 bottom panels


Fauxlix, Fauxir, Fega p2, 6 god , and 6 ERGOd top panels - A collection of layouts that will house your arcade buttons and RP2040. these are just Viewlix, Noir, Sega p2, 6 Gawd, and 6 ERGOd(my personal ergo 6 gawd format) scaled down to use primarily 24mm buttons and will use 30mm as thumb buttons. 


Plates - Cut acrylic/steel Ergod (UNTESTED) - This are just files for acrylic and steel cut parts for the tops and bottom of the fight stick, please note that this includes some 3d printed parts because the electronics housings and RP2040 mount are different.

Construction process
-------------
- Build Frame
- Mount top face
- Flip upside and down insert buttons, put electronics in housings and then slot them into the top face plate (they press fit between the top and bottom faces), wire everything, add RP mount lid (cable cover)
- mount bottom plate
- set up/config RP2040
- Plug in
- enjoy?
- Give feedback (Optional)
